# agent-narrator

**Hear your coding agents work.** A terminal-native CLI that tails every live
agent session on your machine (Claude Code and Codex), distills each step into
one calm spoken line with a bring-your-own-key LLM, and reads it aloud. Errors
and "the agent needs you" moments always speak first, and every agent announces
when it goes idle or gets back to work.

Run a stack of agents without staring at a stack of terminals.

## Why this exists

[Agent FM](https://www.agentfm.ai/) (YC S26) had a great idea — turn your coding
agents into something you can *hear* — but it's a macOS-only app, and I'm on
Windows. So I built my own take: cross-platform, terminal-native, open source,
and it watches **multiple** agents at once. Same core idea, different machine,
and you can read every line of it.

## How it works

```
~/.claude/projects/**/*.jsonl   ~/.codex/sessions/**/*.jsonl   (appended live)
        │                              │
        ▼                              ▼
   sources.py — discover sessions + parse each format into events
        │
        ▼
   multiplexer.py — every active session is a "station": own handle,
        │            own batch, own idle clock; new sessions join live,
        │            stale ones sign off
        ▼
   summarizer.py ──► tts.py
    ONE spoken line     shared speech queue: per-station newest-state-wins,
    per station batch   errors jump everyone, station names prefix the lines
```

- **Local-first, BYO-key.** Your transcripts never leave your machine except as
  the short event batch sent to *your* LLM provider. No hosted proxy, no account.
- **Never falls behind.** TTS runs on a worker thread; stale lines are dropped so
  you always hear the *newest* state, and errors/attention jump the queue.
- **Great voice for free.** The default voice is a Microsoft Edge neural voice
  (`edge-tts`) — natural-sounding, no key. A paid `OPENAI_API_KEY` upgrades to
  OpenAI TTS; `--local` drops to a fully offline voice.
- **Degrades gracefully.** No API key? Template narration (`--no-llm`). API
  down? Falls back to templates. Online voice fails? Falls back to the offline
  voice. The narrator never dies mid-session.

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AnSa30-06/agent-narrator-for-windows
cd agent-narrator-for-windows
pip install -e .        # or: pipx install .
```

Python 3.10+. On Linux the offline voice needs espeak:
`sudo apt install espeak-ng libespeak1`.

## Quickstart

```bash
cp .env.example .env    # add OPENAI_API_KEY or GEMINI_API_KEY (optional)
agent-narrator          # tunes into EVERY active agent session (up to 6)
```

Then use Claude Code (or Codex) in other terminals and listen. With several
agents running you hear station-prefixed lines — "checkout-service: three tests
fail around tax rounding" — plus "X has gone idle" / "X is back at work" as each
agent stops and starts.

No key? It works out of the box:

```bash
agent-narrator --no-llm --local
```

Replay a finished session as a spoken story (the quickest way to hear it):

```bash
agent-narrator --replay --session ~/.claude/projects/<project>/<session>.jsonl
```

## Flags

| Flag | Default | What it does |
|------|---------|--------------|
| `--sources LIST` | `claude,codex` | Which agent transcripts to watch |
| `--stations N` | `6` | Max concurrent sessions narrated at once |
| `--session PATH` | — | Narrate ONE specific session `.jsonl` (single-station mode) |
| `--replay` | off | (with `--session`) read the whole session, then exit |
| `--projects-dir PATH` | `~/.claude/projects` | Claude Code sessions location |
| `--codex-dir PATH` | `~/.codex/sessions` | Codex sessions location |
| `--provider {auto,openai,gemini,none}` | `auto` | LLM for narration lines |
| `--no-llm` | off | Template lines, zero keys needed |
| `--local` | off | Force fully offline TTS (pyttsx3) |
| `--mute` | off | Print lines, speak nothing |
| `--voice NAME` | `en-US-AriaNeural` | Edge neural voice (`edge-tts --list-voices`), or an OpenAI voice like `alloy` |
| `--verbosity {quiet,normal,chatty}` | `normal` | quiet = errors/attention only; chatty = +your own messages |
| `--idle-timeout SECONDS` | `25` | Silence before a station is announced idle |

## Keys (`.env`)

The **voice is free by default** (Edge neural — no key at all). Any one of these
unlocks LLM narration lines (all optional):

- `OPENAI_API_KEY` — gpt-4o-mini lines **and** the OpenAI TTS voice
- `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` — any OpenAI-compatible model for lines
  (`OPENAI_BASE_URL` + `OPENAI_MODEL` for other compatible endpoints)
- `GEMINI_API_KEY` — gemini flash lines

A full session narrates for well under $0.05 with gpt-4o-mini.

## Behavior details

- Start a new agent mid-broadcast? Its station joins live ("New station:
  devour-io") at the current moment, never replaying old history. Stations that
  go quiet sign off and free their slot for a busier one.
- Each station announces "has gone idle" / "is back at work", so you always know
  which agents are actually doing something.
- Assistant "thinking"/"reasoning" blocks are never narrated. Claude subagent
  sidechains are skipped.
- Attention detection: questions and approval/permission/blocked phrasing are
  spoken immediately, ahead of everything else.
- One chatty agent can't drown out a quiet one: stale-line dropping is
  per-station, and errors from any station jump the whole queue.
- `Ctrl-C` signs off cleanly.

## Roadmap

- OpenCode transcript support (one more class in `sources.py`)
- A distinct chime before blocker/attention lines
- Per-station voices, and a `--focus <station>` solo mode
- Piper as a higher-quality offline voice
